                <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h3>
                <p> Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return 
                    winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname 
                    long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near
                     it because of the number of folks that came to visit and 
                     fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that 
                     they never left
                </p>
                <p> Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The
                     Salmon is one of the longest undammed rivers in the United 
                     States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, 
                     faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower,
                      and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                       summer...but families with children who like to swim 
                       tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
                        water more.</p>

                <h2>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
                <p> Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the
                    most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows 
                    towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High 
                    grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great 
                    rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs 
                    from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green
                     River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting
                      geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic 
                      human activity, and great whitewater opportunities. </p>
                <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done 
                    in 6 days</p>
                <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National
                     Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness
                      and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                <h2>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
                <p> This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy 
                    of all river trips. You will never forget your visit
                     to the Grand Canyon.</p>
                <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater 
                    with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable 
                    river experience. The canyon is filled not only with 
                    exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons
                     and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p>
                <p>The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale.
                     The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10)
                      to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river 
                      variances. However, most people are familiar with the
                       regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
