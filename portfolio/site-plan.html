      <p>
        This home page displays some of my work related to data wrangling and 
        analysis. Datasets were published elsewhere and
        used for educative and dissemination purposes.
        

        <br>
        <br>        
        In this case study, I created effective data
        visualizations in ggplot to show multivariate relationships. The dataset
        belongs to Our World in Data.

        <br>
        <br>
        The plot is restricted for 1963. Similar plot can be obtained
        with the package gapminder. The world is divided in two groups defined
        by child mortality and fertility rate aroudn the world.

        Over the years, health is improving around the world, and child
        mortality in poor countries decreases. Developed countries have the
        lowest child mortality and fertility rate.

        <br>
        <br>
        For this work, I built an app that uses an ETL and machine learning
        pipeline to categorize responses during a disaster. The dataset was
        provided by Figure Eight (now acquired by Appen and contains pre-labeled
        tweets and text messages from real-life disasters. This code cleans and
        reorganizes the dataset to build a machine learning model. The model can
        tag a tweet or message with an appropriate response organization to help
        during an ongoing disaster. During such threatening events, help
        organizations lack the required capacity to filter the millions of
        tweets to focus on the real important ones. The machine learning model
        provided here can speed up the work of delivering medical supplies, and
        water, or attending to blocked roads.

        The provided code follows an ETL pipeline. The pipeline loads the *.csv
        datasets, merge and cleans them, and stores the result information in a
        SQLite database *.db. Then a a machine learning pipeline loads the
        SQLite dataset, splits it into training and test sets, builds a machine
        learning model to process the text and train on it using GridSearchCV,
        and outputs the result on the test set. The run.py script exports the
        model as a pickle file *.pkl, ready to be used during critical situations.

        <br>
        <br>

        Here I created a Python package that implements a class to handle different
        calculations to obtain the electronic density of states of a
        nanomaterial. The code is based on the iterative use of the Dyson
        equation through a process called "dressing up" or "decimation." It is
        assumed the system is periodic along the axial axis.

        I provided ready to use methods to calculate and display the electronic
        density of a linear chain of atoms and for the smallest zigzag graphene
        nanoribbon, respectively.

      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer student passionate about creating effective
        visualizations. I have excellent skills on adapting messy data-sets into
        desirable formats for analysis. Also, my experience with the design,
        edition, and complex queries of relational data-bases can be valuable
        for data science teams. Currently, I am seeking to help a company with
        data-driven decisions and develop my own skills as a data scientist.
        Recently, I have helped several groups around the globe to apply machine
        learning techniques to accelerate materials discovery and how they can
        be used to solve real-world problems.
        <br>
        In my free time, I enjoy playing with my son, reading business
        related books, or learning something new. For example, the figures below
        were generated using a deep learning technique to produce artistic
        outputs either from a real photo from my baby, or from a carbon-oxygen-carbon
        density charge visualization of an oxidized graphene nanoribbon.
