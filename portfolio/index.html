                    In this case study, I created effective data visualizations
                    in ggplot to show multivariate relationships. The dataset
                    belongs to Our World in Data. <br>

                    The plot is restricted for 1963. Similar plot can be 
                    obtained with the package gapminder. The world is divided
                    in two groups defined by child mortality and fertility 
                    rate aroudn the world. Over the years, health is 
                    improving around the world, and child mortality in poor
                    countries decreases. Developed countries have the lowest
                    child mortality and fertility rate.

                <div class="description">
                    For this work, I built an app that uses an ETL and machine 
                    learning pipeline to categorize responses during a disaster.
                    The dataset was provided by Figure Eight (now acquired by
                    Appen and contains pre-labeled tweets and text messages 
                    from real-life disasters. This code cleans and reorganizes
                    the dataset to build a machine learning model. The model
                    can tag a tweet or message with an appropriate response
                    organization to help during an ongoing disaster. 
                    During such threatening events, help organizations 
                    lack the required capacity to filter the millions of 
                    tweets to focus on the real important ones. The machine
                    learning model provided here can speed up the work of
                    delivering medical supplies, and water, or attending 
                    to blocked roads. The provided code follows an ETL 
                    pipeline. The pipeline loads the *.csv datasets, 
                    merge and cleans them, and stores the result
                    information in a SQLite database *.db. Then a a 
                    machine learning pipeline loads the SQLite dataset,
                    splits it into training and test sets, builds a 
                    machine learning model to process the text and 
                    train on it using GridSearchCV, and outputs the 
                    result on the test set. The run.py script exports
                    the model as a pickle file *.pkl, ready to be 
                    used during critical situations.

                    Here I created a Python package that implements a class to 
                    handle different calculations to obtain the electronic
                    density of states of a nanomaterial. The code is based 
                    on the iterative use of the Dyson equation through a
                    process called "dressing up" or "decimation." It is
                    assumed the system is periodic along the axial axis. 
                    I provided ready to use methods to calculate and 
                    display the electronic density of a linear chain of atoms
                    and for the smallest zigzag graphene nanoribbon,

                <p>Enjoy the breathtaking scenery. From valleys, meadows,

                    the rapids. It's a great way to get away 
                    from it all and relax amongst all the beauty of 
                    the great outdoors. </p>
